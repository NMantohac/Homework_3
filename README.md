Description:
  - A password generator that generates a random password based on the criteria of the password length and character types. The password 
    length must be a number that's at least 8 characters, but no more than 128 characters in the input box, and at least one option under
    character types must be chosen (checkmark box) in order to overall generate a random password. Otherwise, an instruction will be
    shown in the password box. The website is also a responsive layout for mobile screens, which means that the elements are nicely fit 
    in different screens sizes.
  - The password generator and the website is done through HTML, CSS, and Javascript code in Visual Studio Code, and utilizes
    Bootstrap with its components and utilities. The css file contains standard css practices and media queries, whereas in the
    javascript file, it contains variables (large amounts), objects, functions, for-loops, and if-else statements.
  
 Technologies:
  - Visual Studio Code
  - HTML, CSS, Javascript
  - Bootstrap
  
  Challenges:
  - This was a challenging homework merely because instead of doing alerts/confirms/prompts for my password criteria, I decided to 
    implement a password length input box and character type(s) checkboxes. This means that I had to take extra steps, and careful 
    thought and consideration in my javascript code. Overall, it was a fun challenge, but in retrospect, I think this was needed 
    in order for me to test myself to see what I've truly learned... and the result is something I'm really proud of!
  - Most, if not all the difficulty was in the javascript code. After targeting the required HTML ID's through querySelector, I had a
    truly tough time writing the rest of the code from there. I didn't really know where to start and I was slightly overwhelmed with
    numerous thoughts of what I needed to implement, so I tried my best to pseudo-code and write it all down. I found myself going back
    through lecture videos a lot and also looking through a couple password generator examples online in order for me to understand
    their javascript code.
  - I definitely have learned quite a bit in regards to javascript compared to before I even started out this homework. After going 
    through lecture videos, reading a bunch of javascript documentation, and looking through various questions/answers in stackoverflow,     I was able to understand the concepts I didn't understand before and was able to implement them.
  - I was able to solve each of my problem through persistent effort and using my online resources!
